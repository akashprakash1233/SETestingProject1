This is Part 2 of the project MP1.

Instructions to run code:

Compile the files TestSootCallGraph.java and Example.java to ensure there are no syntax or compile time errors
Run the code in order to get the desired output.

The purpose of this task was for call graph construction with the help of the topic of data flow analysis. Here we have two files, Example.java containing all the examples methods (Ex. abstract class Animal) in order for the user to see all the results and the TestSootCallGraph which contains the code for printing out every call edge and the total number of call edges in the class Example. Also the answer to which method does animal.saySomething() in the main method call is the Cat.saySomething(). Additionally, the output received on Eclipse goes as follows.. <Example: Animal selectAnimal()> may call <Cat: void <init>()>Total Edges:12
