This is Part 1 of the project MP1. 

Instructions to run code:

1. Compile the files DominatorFinder.java, GCD.java and TestDominatorFinder.java to ensure there are no syntax or compile time errors
2. Run the codd in order to get the desired output. 

The process includes with the given sample code TestDominatorFinder.java , Dominator.java and GCD.java. The TestDominatorFinder.java. 
First uses Soot to build a control flow graph for each method and from there constructs a DominatorFinder object for each control flow graph. 
The output received is coming from a given method (m) and a following statement (s). The displayed output will be the result of the following..
in the given method contains lot of statements and the output will show the all the statements in m that dominates s. In the code, the doAnalysis() method has 
already been completed, therefore that part of the code has not been tampered with or modified.
